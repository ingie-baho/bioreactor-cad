## Bioreactor System Overview

This repository contains all CAD for a modular bioreactor system designed for cultivating cyanobacteria and processing biomass through lysis and filtration.

### Bioreactor Module
The bioreactor is used to culture *Synechocystis* and includes the following instrumentation:
- **Optical Density (OD) Sensor** for real-time growth monitoring
- **pH, Dissolved Oxygen, and Temperature Probes** to monitor environmental conditions
- **Air Pump and Sparger** for continuous aeration
- **Light Source** (shown in CAD) for illumination of the culture

### Lysis Module
This module is designed for cell lysis and includes:
- **pH Probe and Temperature Sensor**
- **Two Peristaltic Pumps** connected to acid and base reservoirs for controlled chemical lysis
- **Ultrasonic Probe** for physical cell disruption

### Filtration Module
The filtration system includes:
- **Pressure Safety Valve** for overpressure protection
- **Tubing connected to a Pressure Regulator and Air Compressor** (air compressor not shown)
- **Syringe Filter** for cell debris removal
- **Filtrate Outlet Tubing** for downstream collection

All modules are designed to be integrated but can operate independently for modular testing and development.
